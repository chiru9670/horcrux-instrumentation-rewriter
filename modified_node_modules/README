This stores all the files I modified in the node_modules folder of horcrux-instrumentation-rewriter.
After doing npm install in the horcrux-instrumentation-rewriter folder, go to node_modules folder, and replace any file there that is also present in modified_node_modules, with the one in modified_node_modules.
For eg. you need to replace node_modules/deterministic/lib/index.js with modified_node_modules/deterministic/lib/index.js
